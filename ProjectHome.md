Uikludges project provides a distribution for components missing from Nokia's Python for Series 60. The project follows grassroots open source model, inviting everyone to participate and enhance a common codebase. High quality, sustainability and the maintenance of the components is guaranteed by stimulating developer activity and providing unified and handy toolchain.

## Current version ##

**0.2**. Released 1.4.2008.

## Features ##

See [Features](Features.md) page for more information about provided components and the future.

**Only Series 60 3rd edition devices are supported.**

## Installation ##

Unsigned uikludges.sis is available from the download page. But it's pretty much useless due to Symbian platform security; you must be able to change UIDs inside SIS files.

See [Installation](Installation.md) page for more instructions.

## Download ##

Preferred download method is Subversion source code checkout from Google Code. Other forms of source code distributions are not provided. Unsigned SIS is available from [download](http://code.google.com/p/uikludges/downloads/list) page, but it might have installation issues due to Symbian platform security.

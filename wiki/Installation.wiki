== By building ==

Symbian platform security makes it difficult to distribute development binaries. Thus, we recommend you to build this thing your self.

By default:

 * uikludges is built with all developer certificate capabilities assigned to DLL files
 
 * uikludges uses protected UID range (UIDs reserved for Red Innovation Ltd.)

To build your own version

 * Get a developer certificate, Series 60 SDK, Python for Series 60 source code

 * Reserve UIDs for yourself

 * Fix UID references in source code 

 * Rebuild 

 * Sign SIS with your own certificate

 * Install to the phone

See [http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60_extensions_creation_using_Carbide this tutorial] for more information how to create your own PyS60 Native extensions using Carbide C++.



== By SIS hacking ==

Other way is to get Ensymble and other [http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=129040&highlight=unsis SIS manipulation tools] and change capabilities and UIDs directly in the binary file.
